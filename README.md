# Insight this is our first Android Application
 If you’re a customer waiting in line to get a movie ticket is a hassle and you might even miss the beginning of the movie if you waste time on long queues. And if you’re an admin in charge of managing movie details you might want to have a portable way of managing them. We came up with a solution to address both these problems the solution is Insight. We have managed to implement both Admin and user Tasks into on single application.
